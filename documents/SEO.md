SEO, or search engine optimization, is a way to optimize a website's visibility in a search engine results page. Lots and lots of people
use Google to answer questions, look for products, and gain information. For a business owner or someone who just wants their site to get
lots of attention, optimizing their site so typical related searches will pick it up is very important for increasing business and visibility.

One way to increase SEO is to identify the keywords associated with what people are searching for when they want something that's aligned
with your website. You can use Uber Suggest or the Google Keyword tool to determine that. Then, you can implement those keywords in your site's
content. You can do this by incorporating a few keywords into your title tag, for instance. 

Another thing you can do is change the meta description. The meta description is another HTML element that is not displayed on the site, 
but shows information about the site in the Google result. By putting keywords in this metadata, your site will be more informative and 
attract more visitors. 

You can also modify alt attributes for images and body content, among other features of your website, to attract visitors and show up better in a search result.
