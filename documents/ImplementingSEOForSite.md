To maximize SEO on my site, I would do a few things:

Add informative titles that clearly communicate what each site's page is about and mention keywords that would show up on a Google search. I might use Google analytics tools to determine what keywords people are googling to get to similar sites, and emphasize incorporating those. 

I would change the metadata to be clear and informative. 

I would update the layout to make the page really easy to follow and increase sizes of links to make them easier to see. I might update color schemes if I think those aren't clear enough.

I would add a Facebook share for certain pages of the site that show off the school.
